# Principle Experiments

[Principle for Mac](http://principleformac.com/) is a rapid prototyping tool similar to [FramerJS](http://framerjs.com), except ever. This repository contains a selection of experiments that I created in order to learn Principle and can hopefully serve as a resource to help others in their Principle explorations.
